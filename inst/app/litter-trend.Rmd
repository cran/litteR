## Trend analysis

For each spatial code and the type names and group codes specified in the settings file, the following statistics have been estimated for the period `r str_c(DATE_FROM, " to ", DATE_TO)`:

- from: the first date of the time-series;
- to: the final date of the time-series;
- [Theil-Sen slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator) (slope): a robust non-parametric estimator of slope (counts / year);
- [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value): the p-value associated with the one-tailed [Mann-Kendall test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient) to test the null hypothesis of 
    - no monotonically _increasing_ trend in case the Theil-Sen slope is greater than zero;
    - no monotonically _decreasing_ trend in case the Theil-Sen slope is smaller than zero;
- the number of surveys (N);

A p-value less than an _a priori_ specified [significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) (say, &alpha; = 0.05), indicates a significant trend. If the p-value is greater than this significance level, we can't say that there is no trend. We can only conclude that our data do not show evidence of a trend (due to lack of data, noise, etc.).

The Mann-Kendall test is a non-parametric test and as such does not make distributional assumptions on the data.
